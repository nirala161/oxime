    <h1>Welcome to oxime</h1>
    <h2>Hello user,<br>
    <pre>     In this application, I propose to use a mobile phoneâ€™s camera to estimate two vital cardiovascular parameters namely,
         pulse oximeter (SpO2) level and pulse-rate.
    </pre>
    </h2>

    <h2>
        Steps :
    </h2>
    <p>
        <ol>

            <li>
                Place your index finger on mobile's back camera and record a video of approx 20 second by turning on your flashlight.
            </li>
            <li>
                <srtong>Don't choose the prerecoded file do current recording by choosing camcorder option.</srtong>

            </li>
            <li>
                If your video size is higher than 50 MB then program will terminate automatically due to server storage limit.
            </li>
            <li>
                Try to keep video size low as possible by setting up your recording quality for this purpose.

            <li>
                The result will depend upon the video you are posting.
            </li>
            <li>
                The results from the developed application follow very closely with standard devices and this is valid for all the ranges of SpO2 values.
            </li>
